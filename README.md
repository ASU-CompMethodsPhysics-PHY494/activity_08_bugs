## Additional packages required for testing

If you want to run all tests locally then install the
[pytest-timeout](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-timeout/) package
first with the command

    conda install pytest-timeout

This installation only needs to be done once. Some tests require this
package to work properly.


## Problems

Read the comments in each file to understand what the code *ought* to
do. Then **fix the bugs in the files `bug_01.py` to `bug_09.py`** so
that the code *actually* does what it is supposed to be doing...
